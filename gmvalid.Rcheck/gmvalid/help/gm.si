_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Computes the synergy index of two discrete variables in relation
     to  a binary group variable.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     gm.si(X,Y,group,data=0,reference=c(1,1,2),conf.level = 0.95)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       X: Index of the variable's position in 'data' or a vector. 

       Y: Index of the variable's position in 'data' or a vector. 

   group: Binary group or outcome variable addressed as variable index
          in  'data' or as vector.

    data: Data frame or table. 

reference: Vector to define the 'reference' categories of 'X', 'Y' and
          'group'. By default, 2 is the reference category for group.

conf.level: Confidence level of the interval (default is 0.95). 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Rothman's synergy index (S) is an interaction measure between two
     discrete variables on a dichotomous outcome.  The index equals 1
     under additivity, S > 1 in the case of synergy and  S < 1 in the
     presence of antagonism.

     The synergy index is originally constructed on (2 x 2)-tables, but
     (i x j)-tables can also be analyzed. Then (i-1) x (j-1) synergy
     indices are computed and combined to  an overall synergy index.    

     The confidence intervalls are calculated using the asymptotic
     variance given in  Rothman (1974).

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list containing: 

  ratio : A rate ratio table, more precise [P( group=reference,X,Y ) /
          P( group=NOT reference,X,Y )] / [min(P( group=reference,X,Y )
          / P( group=NOT reference,X,Y ))] 

covariance: Covariances matrix of the single synergy indices.  Not
          written if 'X' or 'Y' are binary.

measure : Matrix containing the estimate(s), standard deviation(s), 
          confidence interval(s) and p-value(s). Figures in brackets
          show the reference category respectively the category under
          consideration.
                            If both factors 'X' and 'Y' are binary,
          confidence  intervals for case-control as well as cohort
          designs are computed. If at least one factor has more than 2
          categories, the overall synergy index with its corresponding
          confidence interval is computed that follows a  case-control
          design.

_N_o_t_e:

     It can occur that certain combinations of categories lead to a
     negative synergy indices. In that case no confidence intervals can
     be computed. If so, use the 'reference' option to re-order the
     categories of the variable(s) in question (see example below).
