_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Graphical model selection by different selection strategies.  The
     selected graph is plotted where line thickness corresponds to an
     optional edge measure.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     gm.analysis(data, edge.measure = c("gamma.cond", "marg.gamma", "cor", "boot",
                 "cov", "p.value"), program = c("mim", "coco"),
                 strategy = c("backwards", "forwards", "eh"), 
                 plot.significant = TRUE, boot.N = 100, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    data: Data frame or a table (array) with at least 2 denominated
          variables. 

edge.measure: One of "gamma.cond", "marg.gamma", "cor", "boot", "cov",
          "p.value". To be plotted in the graph. May be abbreviated.
          See details. 

 program: Selects whether MIM or the CoCo package is used for model
          selection. Calls either the function 'gm.coco' or 'gm.mim'.
          May be abbreviated. 

strategy: See 'gm.coco' or 'gm.mim'. 

plot.significant: If TRUE only significant edges in the selected models
          are plotted (in solid lines). If FALSE also not significant
          edges are plotted as dashed lines. 

  boot.N: Only required if 'edge.measure' is "boot". Specifies the
          number of bootstrap replications. 

     ...: Further options of 'gm.coco' or 'gm.mim' can be given. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Different edge measures:
      "gamma.cond" - Conditional gamma coefficient, calls 'gm.gamma'
     with type = conditional.
      "marg.gamma" - Marginal gamma coefficient, calls 'gm.gamma' with
     type = marginal.
      "cor" - Pearson's correlation coefficient, calls 'cor'.
      "boot" - calls 'gm.boot.mim' or 'gm.boot.coco' depending on the
     choice of 'program'. 'boot.N' bootstrap replications will be done.
     The relative edge frequency will be plotted next to it.
      "cov" - Pearson's covariance, calls 'cov'. 
      "p.value" - is only available if 'program' choice was "mim". Then
     'plot.significant' is set to TRUE since the p-value is only
     available for edges present in the model. In this case the edges
     will be plotted thinner the smaller the p-value.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list containing: 

"strategy": One of "backwards","forwards" and "eh". 

"model" : String vector of the accepted and plotted models. 

"edge.measure" : Character string indicating what type of edge measure
          was performed. 

"analysis": Upper-tri matrix with the result of the edge measure
          values. 

"variable names": Matrix that assigns a letter to each variable that is
          used in the model formulas. 

_N_o_t_e:

     The option 'boot' may take some time depending on the size of
     'boot.N'.
