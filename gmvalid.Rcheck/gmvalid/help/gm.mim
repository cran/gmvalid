_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Selects one or more graphical models (depending on strategy) using
     the program MIM. Different types of model selection are available.
     A base model can be optionally defined.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     gm.mim(data, strategy = c("backwards", "forwards", "eh"),
             model = FALSE, chain = FALSE, options = "")

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    data: Data frame or a table (array). Variables should have names.
          'data' has to be discrete. 

strategy: Type of model selection. "backwards" searches for not
          significant edges to delete, starting from the saturated
          model as default. "forwards" adds significant edges, starting
          from the main effects model. The "Edwards-Havranek" model
          search rejects complete models in every step and finishes
          with one or more accepted models. The default strategy is
          "backwards". Selections may be abbreviated. 

   model: Character string specifying a start model for "backwards" and
          "forwards" selection procedure. For the "eh" procedure a
          minimal and a maximal model has to be assigned in one string
          connected with a " - " (see Example). The model formulae has
          to start with the first lowercase letters of the alphabet,
          e.g. "abc,cde". Variable names cannot be given. 

   chain: Character string to specify the block structure of directed
          graphical models. The syntax is "vs1|vs2|vs3" where
          vs1,vs2,vs3 are sets of variables and the variables in vs1
          are prior to those in vs2 etc. The formula has to be given
          with the first lowercase letters of the alphabet, e.g.
          "a|bc|d". Variable names cannot be given. For more
          information search the MIM help for "block overview". 

 options: Character string specifying further options for the search
          strategy. Possible options can be found in the MIM help when
          searching for "stepwise" (backwards, forwards) or
          "startsearch" (eh).  See 'details'. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     MIM options for stepwise procedures (backwards, forwards):
      "A" - uses the AIC as selection criterion
      "B" - uses the BIC as selection criterion
      "J" - joggles between backward and forward
      "N" - non coherent mode
      "U" - unrestricted, allows for non-decomposable models;

     MIM options for the eh modelsearch:
      (positive number) - maximum number of models fitted
      white space
      (letters) - "U" for upward search, "D" for downward, default is
     both.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list containing: 

"accepted" : String vector of the accepted model(s). 

"rejected" : String vector of the rejected model(s). 

  "base": Character string with the base model the selection started
          with. NA for "eh". 

"strategy": Character string indicating what type of selection strategy
          was performed. 

"tests against saturated": Matrix giving the test results of the
          accepted and the rejected models against the saturated model. 

"p values": Upper-tri matrix with p-values of those edges in the
          accepted models. NA if edge is misseing. 

"variable names": Matrix that assigns a letter to each variable that is
          used in the model formulas. 

_N_o_t_e:

     The function requires the MIM program. Make sure that it is
     running before using the function. The package mimR will only work
     properly if your temporary directory has a path where every folder
     has a name containing only 8 letters or less. mimR needs the
     Rgraphviz package. Therefore you will have to add "Bioconductor"
     to your R repositories.
