_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Selects one or more graphical models (depending on strategy) using
     the CoCo package. Different types of model selection are
     available. A base model can be optionally defined.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     gm.coco(data, strategy = c("backwards", "forwards", "eh"), model = FALSE, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    data: Data frame or a table (array). Variables should have names,
          'data' has to be discrete. 

strategy: Type of model selection. "backwards" searches for not
          significant edges to delete, starting from the saturated
          model as default ('backward'). "forwards" adds significant
          edges, starting from the main effects model ('forward'). The
          "Edwards-Havranek" model search rejects complete models in
          every step and finishes with one or more accepted models
          ('eh'). The default strategy is "backwards". Selections may
          be abbreviated. 

   model: Character string specifying a start model for "backwards" and
          "forwards" selection procedure. For "eh" a character string
          would specify the base model for tests. Since "eh" searches
          for models between a defined minimal and a maximal model, a
          string vector of length 2 is another option. In this case a
          minimal and a maximal model is to be given. The model
          formulae has to start with the first lowercase letters of the
          alphabet, e.g. "abc,cde". Variable names cannot be given. 

     ...: Additional options to be given to the selection procedures.
          See 'backward' (forward) or 'eh'. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list containing: 

"accepted" : String vector of the accepted model(s). 

"rejected" : String vector of the rejected model(s). 

  "base": Character string giving the base model the selection started
          with. 

"strategy": Character string indicating what type of selection strategy
          was performed. 

 "tests": Matrix containing the test results of the accepted vs. the
          rejected models  (available if at least one of the models is
          submodel of another one). Otherwise the accepted and rejected
          models are tested against the saturated model. 

"variable names": Matrix that assigns a letter to each variable used in
          the model formulas. 

_N_o_t_e:

     CoCo may crash R occasionally on a bad day. We tried to prevent
     all crash causes for discrete data. The R version of CoCo can only
     handle one CoCoObject. You may run "endCoCo()" if you use CoCo
     also outside this package or the function aborts.

       gm.coco(wam,recursive=TRUE,follow=TRUE,decomposable.mode=TRUE,
                 coherent=TRUE,IC=TRUE,BIC=TRUE)
