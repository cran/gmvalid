_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Validates a discrete undirected graphical model using the
     bootstrap. To achieve that the program MIM is used. Relative
     frequencies of the bootstrapped models, cliques or edges are
     counted.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     gm.boot.mim(N, data, strategy = c("backwards", "forwards", "eh"),
                 calculations = c("subgraph", "diff", "edge", "clique"),
                 model = FALSE, options = "")

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       N: Number of bootstrap replications. 

    data: Data frame or a table (array). Variables should have names,
          'data' has to be discrete. 

strategy: Type of model selection. "backwards" searches for not
          significant edges to delete, starting from the saturated
          model as default. "forwards" adds significant edges, starting
          from the main effects model. The "Edwards-Havranek" model
          search rejects complete models in every step and finishes
          with one or more accepted models. The default strategy is
          "backwards". Selections may be abbreviated. 

calculations: String vector specifying the analysis methods.
          "subgraph", "clique" and "edge" show the frequency of
          occurence  in all selected models of the bootstrap samples,
          while "diff" counts the differences in the bootstrap
          replications compared to the edges selected from the original
          data set. The frequency of the selected models of all
          bootstrap samples are always calculated. By default all
          calculations are done. Selections may be abbreviated. 

   model: Character string specifying a start model for "backwards" and
          "forwards" selection procedure. For the "eh" procedure a
          minimal and a maximal model has to be assigned in one string
          connected with a " - " (see Example). The model formula has
          to start with the first lowercase letters of the alphabet,
          e.g. "abc,cde". Variable names cannot be given. 

 options: Optional character string specifying further options for the
          search strategy. Possible options can be found in the MIM
          help searching for "stepwise" (backwards, forwards) or
          "startsearch" (eh).  See 'details'. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     This function uses a nonparametric bootstrap.
      For your information about the advancements of the bootstrap,
     some run numbers will be displayed.

     MIM options for stepwise procedures (backwards, forwards):
      "A" - uses the AIC as selection criterion
      "B" - uses the BIC as selection criterion
      "J" - joggles between backward and forward
      "N" - non coherent mode
      "U" - unrestricted, allows for non-decomposable models;

     MIM options for the eh modelsearch:
      (positive number) - maximum number of models fitted
      white space
      (letters) - "U" for upward search, "D" for downward, default is
     both.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list containing: 

"bootstrapped models" : Relative frequency vector of selected models
          with model formulas as categories. 

"bootstrapped subgraphs" : Relative frequencies vector of subgraphs
          that equals cliques or parts of a clique. Returned if
          calculation "subgraph" is selected. 

"bootstrapped cliques" : Relative frequencies vector selected cliques.
          Returned if calculation "clique" is selected. 

"bootstrapped edges": Matrix with relative frequencies of the edges.
          Returned if calculation "edge" is selected. 

"original model": Character string giving the selected model using the
          original unsampled data. Returned if calculation "diff" is
          selected. 

"differences from original data set": List with frequencies of more,
          less and different edges (See argument 'calculations'. Sorted
          by occurence. Returned if calculation "diff" is selected. 

"variable names": Matrix that assigns a letter to each variable that is
          used in the model formulas. 

_N_o_t_e:

     The function requires the MIM program. Make sure that it is
     running before using the function.
       The package mimR will only work properly if your temporary
     directory has a path where every folder has a name containing only
     8 letters or less. mimR needs the Rgraphviz package. Therefore you
     will have to add "Bioconductor" to your R repositories.
      Running this function may take a while. A bootstrap with data of
     size 10.000 times 8 and 1.000 replications may take the computer
     about 4 minutes.
